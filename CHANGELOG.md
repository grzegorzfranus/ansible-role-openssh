# Changelog

All notable changes to this OpenSSH role will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-24

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- Internal variables renamed from `_name_` to `__openssh_*` convention per Red Hat CoP 3.1.4
  - These were never part of the public API but may affect playbooks referencing them directly
- `openssh_sshd_validate_command` removed from `vars/main.yml` — now only in `defaults/main.yml`, allowing user overrides
- `openssh_challenge_response_auth` renamed to `openssh_kbd_interactive_auth`
  - `ChallengeResponseAuthentication` deprecated in OpenSSH 8.7 (bz#3303), replaced by `KbdInteractiveAuthentication`
  - Template now renders version-appropriate directive automatically

### Added ✅
- `meta/argument_specs.yml` for formal argument validation (Ansible 2.11+, CoP 3.1.20)
- `requirements.yml` for collection dependency declaration (`ansible.posix`, `community.general`)
- README: Role Properties section — idempotent, atomic, rollback, check mode designations (CoP 3.1.17)
- README: Managed Configuration Files section with replacement warning (CoP 3.1.14)
- README: Collection Dependencies section with install instructions
- README: Role Outcome section describing post-execution guarantees
- OpenSSH version detection in `tasks/algorithms.yml` for conditional directive rendering
- `ansible-lint` added to CI lint job alongside `yamllint`
- Idempotency test added to Molecule (second converge run)

### Changed 🔄
- SELinux booleans now use `openssh_selinux_chroot_rw_homedirs` and `openssh_selinux_sysadm_login` from defaults instead of hardcoded values
- Handler `restart openssh` now checks `openssh_service_enabled` before restarting
- Handler changed from `ansible.builtin.systemd` to `ansible.builtin.service` for portability
- `.ansible-lint` profile upgraded from `min` to `shared`
- Comment density reduced across all role files — removed boilerplate ASCII-art headers and separators
- `with_items` replaced with `loop` in `tasks/selinux.yml`
- Oracle Linux 9 marked as community-tested (not in CI matrix) in README

### Fixed 🔧
- `tasks/selinux.yml`: `restorecon` task `changed_when: true` replaced with output-based change detection (idempotency fix)
- Template: deprecated `ChallengeResponseAuthentication` → version-conditional `KbdInteractiveAuthentication` rendering

### Quality Improvements 📈
- Full compliance with Red Hat CoP Automation Good Practices v2.0.0
- All internal variables follow `__openssh_*` naming convention
- Formal argument specification enables `ansible-doc` integration and fail-fast validation

## [1.0.6] - 2025-11-23

### Fixed 🔧
- Ansible 2.20 compatibility: replaced deprecated `ansible_os_family` with `ansible_facts['os_family']` syntax
- Resolved deprecation warning: "INJECT_FACTS_AS_VARS default to `True` is deprecated"
- Updated fact references in `tasks/main.yml` and `tasks/selinux.yml` to use modern `ansible_facts` dictionary

### Compatibility 🔄
- Fully compatible with Ansible 2.15 through 2.20 and beyond
- Prepared for Ansible 2.24 where top-level fact injection will be removed

## [1.0.5] - 2025-09-05

### Added ✅
- Variable assertions coverage extended in `tasks/assert.yml`:
  - `openssh_allow_service_stop` (boolean)
  - `openssh_service_name` (non-empty string)
  - `openssh_packages` (non-empty list)
  - `openssh_sshd_validate_command` (string)
- Flow documentation block added to `tasks/algorithms.yml` for clarity.
- README updated to document OS-specific variables and validation command.

### Changed 🔄
- Standardized all task/handler names to "OpenSSH | section | description" and removed emojis from names.
- Aligned tags with the allowed set: replaced `prerequisites` with `requirements`; removed non-standard tags from includes in `tasks/main.yml`.
- Normalized handler name in `handlers/main.yml` (emoji removed).

### Fixed 🔧
- README: removed non-existent variable `openssh_protocol`.
- README: updated Tags section to match allowed tags.

### Quality Improvements 📈
- Lint clean on all edited files.
- Documentation synchronized with defaults and assertions (variables table now consistent).

### Notes 🗒️
- Role naming, tagging, and validation now align with repository Ansible rules.

## [1.0.4] - 2025-08-07

### Added ✅
- Linting configuration: role-local `.yamllint` with 200 column limit and ignores for workflows/Molecule
- Declared required collections in `meta/main.yml`: `ansible.posix`, `community.general`
- Algorithm/version awareness: dynamic probing of supported algorithms (`ssh -Q`) and auto-selection of effective `Ciphers`, `MACs`, `KexAlgorithms`, and `HostKeyAlgorithms` to prevent `sshd -t` failures on older versions

### Changed 🔄
- Service management: when `openssh_service_enabled: false`, the role now stops and disables the service; when true, enables and starts it
- Handler: removed enablement toggle from restart handler to limit handler to restart only
- SELinux configuration reworked to use idempotent modules (`community.general.sefcontext`, `community.general.seport`) and idempotent restorecon execution instead of shell pipes
- Removed obsolete `Protocol` directive from `sshd_config.j2`; protocol 2 is implicit in modern OpenSSH
- Pruned protocol-related defaults and assertions
- Safer service control: added `openssh_allow_service_stop` (default `false`) and protection from stopping SSH when connected over SSH
- Compliance toggle: `openssh_gateway_ports` is tri-state (`yes`/`no`/`clientspecified`) and validated accordingly; template renders the exact value
- Default `MaxStartups` relaxed from `"5:50:10"` to `"10:30:60"`

### Fixed 🔧
- Multiple long-line messages in assertions converted to folded scalars for YAML linting compliance
- FQCN normalization across role tasks where applicable

### Security 🛡️
- Replaced non-idempotent SELinux shell/command operations with proper module usage

### Notes 🗒️
- Molecule scenario files were not modified as per scope; `ansible-lint` syntax-check failures in Molecule are out-of-scope for this change
