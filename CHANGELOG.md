# Changelog

All notable changes to this OpenSSH role will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.5] - 2025-09-05

### Added ‚úÖ
- Variable assertions coverage extended in `tasks/assert.yml`:
  - `openssh_allow_service_stop` (boolean)
  - `openssh_service_name` (non-empty string)
  - `openssh_packages` (non-empty list)
  - `openssh_sshd_validate_command` (string)
- Flow documentation block added to `tasks/algorithms.yml` for clarity.
- README updated to document OS-specific variables and validation command.

### Changed üîÑ
- Standardized all task/handler names to "OpenSSH | section | description" and removed emojis from names.
- Aligned tags with the allowed set: replaced `prerequisites` with `requirements`; removed non-standard tags from includes in `tasks/main.yml`.
- Normalized handler name in `handlers/main.yml` (emoji removed).

### Fixed üîß
- README: removed non-existent variable `openssh_protocol`.
- README: updated Tags section to match allowed tags.

### Quality Improvements üìà
- Lint clean on all edited files.
- Documentation synchronized with defaults and assertions (variables table now consistent).

### Notes üóíÔ∏è
- Role naming, tagging, and validation now align with repository Ansible rules.

## [1.0.4] - 2025-08-07

### Added ‚úÖ
- Linting configuration: role-local `.yamllint` with 200 column limit and ignores for workflows/Molecule
- Declared required collections in `meta/main.yml`: `ansible.posix`, `community.general`
- Algorithm/version awareness: dynamic probing of supported algorithms (`ssh -Q`) and auto-selection of effective `Ciphers`, `MACs`, `KexAlgorithms`, and `HostKeyAlgorithms` to prevent `sshd -t` failures on older versions

### Changed üîÑ
- Service management: when `openssh_service_enabled: false`, the role now stops and disables the service; when true, enables and starts it
- Handler: removed enablement toggle from restart handler to limit handler to restart only
- SELinux configuration reworked to use idempotent modules (`community.general.sefcontext`, `community.general.seport`) and idempotent restorecon execution instead of shell pipes
- Removed obsolete `Protocol` directive from `sshd_config.j2`; protocol 2 is implicit in modern OpenSSH
- Pruned protocol-related defaults and assertions
- Safer service control: added `openssh_allow_service_stop` (default `false`) and protection from stopping SSH when connected over SSH
- Compliance toggle: `openssh_gateway_ports` is tri-state (`yes`/`no`/`clientspecified`) and validated accordingly; template renders the exact value
- Default `MaxStartups` relaxed from `"5:50:10"` to `"10:30:60"`

### Fixed üîß
- Multiple long-line messages in assertions converted to folded scalars for YAML linting compliance
- FQCN normalization across role tasks where applicable

### Security üõ°Ô∏è
- Replaced non-idempotent SELinux shell/command operations with proper module usage

### Notes üóíÔ∏è
- Molecule scenario files were not modified as per scope; `ansible-lint` syntax-check failures in Molecule are out-of-scope for this change
